# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques. It provides users with personalized movie suggestions based on their viewing history or preferences.

## Overview

The system utilizes the scikit-learn library for building and deploying a recommendation model. The backend is developed using the Flask framework, providing an API for interacting with the recommendation engine. The frontend consists of a simple HTML interface styled with CSS, allowing users to receive movie recommendations.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following key files:

-   `app.py`: This file contains the Flask application code, defining the API endpoints for receiving user input and returning movie recommendations.
-   `recommender.py`: This file likely contains the implementation of the movie recommendation model, potentially using techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.
-   `index.html`: This file provides the basic HTML structure for the user interface where users can interact with the recommendation system.
-   `styles.css`: This file contains the CSS styles used to enhance the visual presentation of the `index.html` page.
-   `test_api.py`: This file likely contains unit or integration tests to verify the functionality of the Flask API.
-   `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python dependencies required to run the project, including Flask, pandas, and scikit-learn.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries, which are listed in `requirements.txt`:

-   Flask (version 2.3.2): A micro web framework for building the API.
-   pandas (version 2.2.1): A powerful data analysis and manipulation library.
-   scikit-learn (version 1.4.2): A machine learning library used for building the recommendation model.

To install these dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt



Setup and Usage
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
(Replace <repository_url> and <repository_name> with the actual URL and name.)

Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application:

Bash

python app.py
This will start the backend API, typically accessible on a local development server (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

Access the user interface: Open the index.html file in your web browser. You should be able to interact with the movie recommendation system through this interface. The frontend will communicate with the backend API to fetch and display movie recommendations.
